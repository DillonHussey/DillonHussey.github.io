## What is this site?
This site is a portfolio of some of my computer science projects
from the last few years.


## Code Sharing
Part of the reason I did this instead of just making my projects on
Github public is that some of the projects I've worked on are still 
active assignments for classes. Making them public could harm
academic integrity. Other projects I have worked on may be private
because I do not own the code.
