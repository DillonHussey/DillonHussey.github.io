## Why I code
I enjoy computer science because I love learning. I know that as a software developer
I will constantly be learning a new skill and improving on what I already know.

## My Studies
I will graduate from Principia College in the Spring of 2024 with majors in Computer
Science and Mathematics, as well as minors in Business and Economics. My favorite
classes so far have been Hardware Architecture and Software Architecture. Hardware 
Architecture took a modular approach to building a computer, starting with combining
simple NAND gates to create a useful component like a D-Flip Flop to use in the
next project to build something more complex. This culminated in building an 8-bit
computer. I helped lead software side for the computer and helped guide the other
team understand how the hardware parts worked together. In Software Architecture
I learned how ARM ISA CPU's operate, and used this knowledge, along with an 
understanding of caching and Stackframes to write better and more efficient code.

## My Notable Experiences

### Work
    - 2021 Summer CSCI Research Assistant for Principia College
        - I helped develop an educational web app which can allow students to 
        participate in Physics labs online.
        - Helped lead the development of another lab. This included streamlining
         the process to create labs by writing utility files for SVG animations
        and standarizing the CSS files to not conflict.
        - Added a Hint feature to labs to help improve the User Experience.
        - Expanded and debugged Postman Test suite to use better coding conventions,
         increase code coverage, and to use global varaibles across tests.
        - Refactored and debugged existing labs to decrease code complexity.
        - Updated SQL server to include data for a new lab.
        - Refactored part of the Redux Store to work with a new feature.
        - Maintianed documentation and wrote a new schema for data.
        
        - Tools used: React, Github, Redux, Webpack, Redux, Postman, CSS, SVGs, Java, 
        mySQL, npm, schemas, RESTful api

    - 2022 Computer Science and Math Tutor
        - I get to spend a few evenings a week teaching other people about what
        I enjoy.
    - 2019 Summer Camp Counselor at Camp Owatonna

### Athletics
    - Lifetime runner, (follow me on Strava :)
    - Collegiate Soccer Player and Track and Field Athlete.
    - Ran Cross Country and Track in high schoool
